Something went wrong with the radio.
Thanks to the ORAN protocol, the data you need to analyze is present is one module. This module contains events with the date they occur.

The format is  `id_year-month-day` concerning the event that is affecting the whole radio (only one affects the radio as a whole).
You have to ask for validation with an RPC as stated in the rules.

Command to run the challenge: `make launch_oran_challenge CHALLENGE=2`
